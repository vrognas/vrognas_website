When setting goals, it is important that it is falsifiable — just like a research hypothesis. An acronym that can be helpful when setting goals, is SMART. With SMART, goals have to be:

**S**pecific  
**M**easurable  
**A**ccepted  
**R**elevant  
**T**ime-bound  

## Specific

What *exactly* is it that you are going to ***do***?
Define the exact action that you have to perform.

## Measurable

How will you *track* your goal? How do you know if you are making progress towards achieving your goal? How do you know when you have reached your goal?

## Accepted

The goal needs to be accepted by yourself. It needs to be *your* goal, not a demand from someone else.

## Relevant

The goal needs to be relevant for what you are trying to achieve.

## Time-bound

Set a deadline for your goal. When does it have to be finished? If it doesn't need to be finished at a specific time — set a deadline anyway, and commit to it. An easy way to commit to a deadline, is to announce it to a few other people and make them hold you accountable when the time is up.
