  Hi! Nice to meet you.

Here’s where I link to my other social media accounts — I also write occasional blog posts. Feel free to look around; I hope you will find something useful!

I am interested in data science and leadership, and currently working on my PhD in [Pharmacometrics at Uppsala University](https://farmaci.uu.se/research/pharmacometrics/).

[My PhD project](https://uac.uu.se/uac-research/colistin-pkpd/) is using statistical models to help overcome [antibiotic resistance](https://www.reactgroup.org/antibiotic-resistance/), and is a part of [Uppsala Antibiotic Center](https://uac.uu.se/).
